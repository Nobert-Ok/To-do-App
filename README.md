# To-do-App
A python app that allows users keep track of their events through reminders
The GUI takes the users tasks and time to start the tasks(in seconds) and stores them in a list of list. 
The reminder works in such a way that the it counts down in seconds and when the time equals 0,
it pops out a notification box indicating that is time to start a new task
